This Project predicts the sales of Rossmann stores for six weeks  using the historical data of 1115 stores for a period of three years.<br>
We were given three Datasets Train, Test and Store.<br>
The main goal of the Project is to predict fututre sales for a retail Giant ROSSMANN so the compnay can plan staffing.<br>
Null Values are replaced with  0 , train and store are merged for easy data preprocessing and cleaning<br>
EDA and Visualisations are done using Seaborn and Bokeh<br>
Features are choosen using corelation matrix and Feature Importance from Tree based algorithms<br>
Random forest regression gave better predictions<br>
# Few conclusions which impacted the sales are <br>
The more facilities the store has the more sales happend<br>
The store with more ameneties has more sales<br>
Discounts and promotions increased the sales<br>
Distance from the competitor increased the sales<br>
